During my two hour coding assessment.

I started to write a strategy about how to go about coding as I usually do.

We are used to importing existing Maven files.
So upon import I was a little confused on why I couldn't import this file?
After a quick Google... I found that Gradle is similar to Maven.
Imported in as existing Gradle project and we're good to go...

Struggle, I spent a little too much time trying to figure out how to go about incorporating Time from user posts.
Heard of PrettyTime but have not used it.. After some research seems to be something used in Maven.
So I stopped trying to focus on the post in Time..
 Continued to write methods to capture user input to be stored in a List.

 Upon more time I would have continued to work out the second option with doing TDD then trying to accommodate those tests to pass to refactor.
